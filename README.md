# ming Inc. The Robot Software Company

Itch: https://nimblebeastscollective.itch.io/ming-inc

In this game you take on the role of a software engineer in the late 70's at ming Inc. using the new ming M80 chip, your task is to develop a functional robot. While your colleague mainly takes care of the hardware, your task is to develop the drivers and write control programs.
The game is a NimbleBeasts community project within the #Devtober event and is in a very early stage of development. We still want to get a lot of feedback, so we want to post a devlog in regular intervals.
